 A Facial Recognition Attendance System is a project that utilizes facial recognition technology to automate the process of taking attendance. 
 It involves capturing images of individuals, detecting faces within those images, and comparing them against a database of known faces to identify individuals. 
 This system can track attendance by recognizing faces and logging attendance records associated with specific individuals, offering a convenient and efficient alternative to traditional attendance trackingÂ methods.
